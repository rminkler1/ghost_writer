# Ghost Writer
The Ghost Writer application is designed to enhance writing productivity by promoting continuous engagement.
Ghost Writer initiates a countdown mechanism that activates whenever the user pauses their writing. 
This visual countdown serves as a motivational tool, prompting the user to maintain a steady pace 
of writing to preserve their work. By instilling a sense of urgency, Ghost Writer effectively mitigates instances of 
writer's block, encouraging users to generate content efficiently. After a predetermined time, the work is safe from 
automatic deletion. Optional writing prompts are available to help the user begin the creative process.

Implemented using Python programming language and tkinter, Ghost Writer offers a streamlined solution for writers seeking to optimize their writing process.

### Requires Python 3.12.1 or later due to tkinter bug
